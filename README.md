  <h1><strong>OneC</strong></h1>
  <p><strong>A collection of custom modules for <a href="https://meteorclient.com/">Meteor Client</a></strong></p>
  <p>Not necessarily useful modules for most people, some of them are taken from watching 5th Column videos and re-creating stuff (BuildCase, for example).</p>

## Credit:

Meteor Client, some snippets, the Discord presence module, and the flight module

## Module List:

- AutoArmorMend, automatically mends armor with bottles o' enchanting in the hotbar.
- AutoSplashPotion, automatically splashes potions from the hotbar if it's effect is not active.
- AutoWither, places withers in front of you, either on click or automatically.
- BetterFlight, **replaces** meteor's flight module, but with hopefully better anti-kick. Will probably conflict with flight modules in other addons if there are any.
- BuildCase, builds a staircase in a cardinal direction, can got up or down, uses blocks from the hotbar in order. Flying is recommended for some uses ;)
- 1c Discord Presence, puts OneC as your Discord activity, show your pride!

### Requires [Meteor Client](https://meteorclient.com/)!
